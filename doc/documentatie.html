          <h3>2.1 Product Description</h3>
          <p>
           PlaCo (Platform for Constructing) is a web application designed to connect construction professionals with potential clients.
          </p>
          <p>
           For each construction firm, essential information such as the company name and contact details will be stored.  The platform will showcase portfolios of completed projects, allowing clients to view images of previous works.
           Clients can upload technical projects, work estimates, or descriptions of their requirements to receive quotations for the desired tasks. If a client requires multiple firms with different specializations, they can select the desired firm for each operation individually. 
           Clients can review the total costs and rate the contracted firms or add comments (positive/negative). The firms will be able to give as well rates and comments on the client's profile. Ratings and comments will be moderated through an administrative account.
          </p>
          <p>
           PlaCo aims to streamline the process of connecting construction professionals with clients efficiently.

            <h3>5. Use of Technologies: Motivation</h3>
            <h4>5.1 CSS</h4>
            <p>
              To make the app as easy to use as possible for everyone who either is a possible customer, or a constructions expert, we chose CSS in our project.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Colors: we primarily chose 3 colors that get the user in the atmosphere of a constructions site: construction helmet, colors of tools, colors of concrete. 
              </li>
    
              <li>
                Fonts: We chose the font 'Inter' because we found it visually appealing for our type of users who read carefully the description of projects.  
              </li>
    
              <li>
                Layout: We mostly displayed the information in columns so that the information could be easily read. 
              </li>
    
              <li>
                Responsiveness: We wanted the application to be accesible for any type of resolution, taking into consideration that nowadays a vast majority of people use their phone for business. 
              </li>
            </ul>
